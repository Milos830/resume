name:          "Miloš Milivojević"
summary:       " 
I'm a Junior Java Developer with seven months experience. I'm working on becoming a Backend Developer and I have focused all my resources on that goal. At the moment I have completed a java developer course for a period of 7 months. In addition to the knowledge I acquired during my course, I aspired to improve myself independently. I completed the final work on the subject -Real estate management system, sales and rental records , making report on real estate both sold and leased, as well as keeping records of employee performance. For making this project I used Eclipse IDE, MySql (Workbench), Java OOP, MVC, JDBC, Swing GUI, Git. At this moment I see myself as a junior or intern in the backend development. I am always ready to improve my knowledge and gain experience through new challenges and I think that being employed in this area would help me make daily progress. I am looking forward to this opportunity and I'm sure I will use it right. For more information, do not hesitate to contact me."
